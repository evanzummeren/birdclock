# Bird clock (Counting Bird homework assignment)
Idea is to create a bird soundscape using Xeno Canto. It grabs the bird sounds and timestamps fom Xeno Canto. You run the script on the backgound through a terminal and once your computer clock aligns with the time that the bird sound was captured it plays the sound (still have to implement that part though).
